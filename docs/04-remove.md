# Remove

This scenario demonstrates how a member can be removed from a group and how the remaining members update their state. It shows the group epoch transitions and how removal proposals and commits are processed.

## Steps Covered

1. **Group Creation**: Alice creates a new MLS group (epoch 0).
2. **Adding Bob**: Alice adds Bob to the group with an Add proposal and Commit (epoch 1).
3. **Bob Joins**: Bob joins the group using the Welcome message (epoch 1).
4. **Removing Bob**: Alice removes Bob from the group with a Remove proposal and Commit (epoch 2).
5. **Bob Processes Removal**: Bob processes the removal commit and is removed from the group (epoch 2).

## Key Concepts

- **Remove Proposal**: A proposal to remove a member from the group, identified by their leaf index.
- **Commit**: Applies the removal and advances the group epoch.
- **Welcome Message**: Used for joining, not for removal. Removed members do not receive a new Welcome.

```typescript
import {
  createGroup,
  Credential,
  generateKeyPackage,
  defaultCapabilities,
  defaultLifetime,
  getCiphersuiteImpl,
  getCiphersuiteFromName,
  createCommit,
  Proposal,
  emptyPskIndex,
  joinGroup,
  processPrivateMessage,
  makePskIndex,
} from "ts-mls"

const impl = await getCiphersuiteImpl(getCiphersuiteFromName("MLS_256_XWING_AES256GCM_SHA512_Ed25519"))
const aliceCredential: Credential = { credentialType: "basic", identity: new TextEncoder().encode("alice") }
const alice = await generateKeyPackage(aliceCredential, defaultCapabilities, defaultLifetime, [], impl)
const groupId = new TextEncoder().encode("group1")

// Alice creates the group, this is epoch 0
let aliceGroup = await createGroup(groupId, alice.publicPackage, alice.privatePackage, [], impl)

const bobCredential: Credential = { credentialType: "basic", identity: new TextEncoder().encode("bob") }
const bob = await generateKeyPackage(bobCredential, defaultCapabilities, defaultLifetime, [], impl)

// Alice adds Bob and commits, this is epoch 1
const addBobProposal: Proposal = {
  proposalType: "add",
  add: { keyPackage: bob.publicPackage },
}
const addBobCommitResult = await createCommit(aliceGroup, emptyPskIndex, false, [addBobProposal], impl)
aliceGroup = addBobCommitResult.newState

// Bob joins the group, he is now also in epoch 1
let bobGroup = await joinGroup(
  addBobCommitResult.welcome!,
  bob.publicPackage,
  bob.privatePackage,
  emptyPskIndex,
  impl,
  aliceGroup.ratchetTree,
)

// Alice removes Bob, transitioning to epoch 2
const removeBobProposal: Proposal = {
  proposalType: "remove",
  remove: { removed: 1 }, // Bob's leaf index
}
const removeBobCommitResult = await createCommit(aliceGroup, emptyPskIndex, false, [removeBobProposal], impl)
aliceGroup = removeBobCommitResult.newState
if (removeBobCommitResult.commit.wireformat !== "mls_private_message") throw new Error("Expected private message")

// Bob processes the removal and is removed from the group (epoch 2)
const bobProcessRemoveResult = await processPrivateMessage(
  bobGroup,
  removeBobCommitResult.commit.privateMessage,
  makePskIndex(bobGroup, {}),
  impl,
)
bobGroup = bobProcessRemoveResult.newState
```

### What to Expect

- After running this scenario, Alice remains in the group, and Bob is removed.
- The group epoch increments with each commit, reflecting the addition and removal of members.
- Bob's state will indicate he is no longer a member after processing the removal commit.
